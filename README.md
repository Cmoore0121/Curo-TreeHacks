# Welcome to Vigor

Vigor was the culmination of a 48-hour coding sprint between myself and my three friends as part of Stanford's 2024 Treehacks Hackathon.

Vigor uses what is called digital phenotyping to predict the mental health stability of the end user and ultimately provide a consumer-facing "score" that indicates how healthy their habits are.
Digital Phenotyping makes use of the variance in one's location and changes in their communication patterns.
